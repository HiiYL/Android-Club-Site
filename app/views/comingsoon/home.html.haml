        MMU Android Student Club is a club founded to gather Android learners in one place - a positive environment for the eager-learners   to conduct discussions, help each other out as well as keeping each other accountable of their learning progress.

      %p
        Every Saturday of 2014/15 Trimester 3, members will gather and code together. There will be sharing sessions which allow club members to share what they have learned, relevant and irrelevant to Android. 

      %p
        Finally, we will have a demo session. Just like how students would present their FYP.

        What Android Student Club Isn't

      %p
        This club is <b>not a workshop</b>. There will not be a lecturer/trainer talking in front, and you doze off at the back.

      %p
        Instead, you are very autonomous in your learning. You will be given a set of tasks that need to be completed for each week, and be expected to complete them before the next club meetup.

      %p
        If you have bumped into problems, or you have question marks in your head when doing the tasks, bring it to the meetup and don't be afraid to ask. <i>(And hopefully got answer lah.)</i>
